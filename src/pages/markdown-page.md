# About the Physical AI Textbook Project

## Hackathon Context
[cite_start]This project was built for **Hackathon I: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**[cite: 1]. [cite_start]The goal was to create an AI-native textbook that bridges the gap between the digital brain and the physical body[cite: 47].

## Tech Stack
This project leverages cutting-edge tools to deliver an interactive learning experience:

* [cite_start]**Framework:** Docusaurus (React-based static site generator)[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**Development:** Built using **Claude Code** and **Spec-Kit Plus**[cite: 16].
* **AI Intelligence:**
    * [cite_start]**RAG Chatbot:** Integrated OpenAI Agents with Qdrant vector database to answer questions based on the book's content[cite: 17, 18].
    * [cite_start]**Context Awareness:** The chatbot can answer questions based specifically on text selected by the user[cite: 18].

## Course Vision
[cite_start]The future of work is a partnership between people, AI agents, and robots[cite: 2]. This textbook prepares students for that future by teaching:
1.  [cite_start]**ROS 2:** The nervous system of robots[cite: 53].
2.  [cite_start]**Gazebo & Unity:** Digital twin simulation[cite: 58].
3.  [cite_start]**NVIDIA Isaac:** AI-powered perception and training[cite: 63].
