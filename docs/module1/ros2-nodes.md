# ROS 2 Nodes and Core Concepts

## Module Focus
[cite_start]This module focuses on the **Robotic Nervous System**, serving as the middleware for robot control[cite: 53, 54]. 

## Core Architecture
[cite_start]To master ROS 2, you must understand its architecture and core concepts[cite: 90]. The fundamental building blocks include:

* [cite_start]**Nodes:** The executable processes that perform computation[cite: 55, 91].
* [cite_start]**Topics:** Named buses over which nodes exchange messages[cite: 55, 91].
* [cite_start]**Services:** Request/reply communication between nodes[cite: 55, 91].
* [cite_start]**Actions:** Goal-oriented communication for long-running tasks[cite: 91].

## Development
In this module, you will learn to:
1.  [cite_start]**Build Packages:** Create ROS 2 packages using Python[cite: 92].
2.  [cite_start]**Bridge Agents:** Connect Python Agents to ROS controllers using `rclpy`[cite: 56].
3.  [cite_start]**Manage Parameters:** Utilize launch files and parameter management for system configuration[cite: 93].

## Assessment
[cite_start]You will be assessed on a **ROS 2 package development project**[cite: 114].
