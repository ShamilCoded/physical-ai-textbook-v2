# Understanding URDF for Humanoids

## Robot Description Formats
To control a humanoid robot, we must first define its physical structure digitally. [cite_start]This section covers **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** and **SDF (Simulation Description Format)**[cite: 57, 96]. 

## Application
You will learn to:
* [cite_start]Define the physical structure of humanoids using URDF[cite: 57].
* [cite_start]Understand the differences between URDF and SDF for simulation environments[cite: 96].
* [cite_start]Prepare robot descriptions for use in simulation tools like Gazebo[cite: 95].
