# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Course Overview
The future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents (AI software), and robots. This course focuses on **Physical AI**, representing a transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

The theme of this course is **AI Systems in the Physical World**, with a goal to bridge the gap between the digital brain and the physical body.

## What You Will Learn
Students will learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using **ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac**.
