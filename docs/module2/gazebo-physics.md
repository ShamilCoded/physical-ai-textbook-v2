# The Digital Twin: Gazebo

## Simulation Environment
[cite_start]Gazebo is used for creating a "Digital Twin" of the robot through physics simulation and environment building[cite: 58, 59]. 

## Key Features
* [cite_start]**Physics Engine:** Simulates physics, gravity, and collisions to mimic the real world[cite: 60, 97].
* [cite_start]**Sensor Simulation:** Simulates critical sensors including LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs[cite: 62, 97].

## Implementation
[cite_start]Students will learn to set up the Gazebo simulation environment and implement physics and sensor simulations[cite: 95, 97]. [cite_start]The assessment for this module includes a **Gazebo simulation implementation**[cite: 115].
